# Codebook
### This database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals
### These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
### Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 

## subject indicates the subject number
## activity indicates the corresponding activity
